subtitle: What is GEMS?
---

GEMS is a student-led group promoting sustainability across campus and beyond. We run projects from September-April/May with the aim of achieving Green Impact Awards every year. New members from any department are welcome throughout the year to get involved with current projects and new project proposals are held between September-October.

We currently are holding weekly meetings on Wednesdays from 1-2pm where we discuss our project proposals and updates whilst also receiving support from Daryl Stump (Dept of Archaeology as well as Dept Environment and Geography) who oversees the projects and submissions however our group is predominantly a student-led group. We are hoping to run volunteer days to recruit volunteers to help with projects and give students an idea of what GEMS is all about.
